# typescript-nodejs-boilerplate

Quick boilerplate setup to start a TS project with prettier, eslint, husky, lint-staged and conventional commits configured

## Usage

Download the files in a new folder that _is not a github repo (meaning no parent has a `.git` folder). To do so, use the following command

>  curl -L https://github.com/gndelia/typescript-nodejs-boilerplate/archive/master.zip -o master.zip

Extract the content from the zip and the inside folder and then install the basic dependencies with

> npm install

and last, but not least, remember to update the  `package.json` metadata (`name`, `description`, `keywords` and so on)

After that, you're good to go!
